### The E-Resource Portfolio Loader

#### Usage
Alma's Portfolio Loader is used in four primary ways: 
1. Activate or deactivate collections linked to your Institution Zone from the Community Zone. (These are titles that are actively managed in the community zone).
2. Create a new electronic collection in the Institution Zone from a list of existing titles.
3. Import and export portfolio information.
4. Update existing electronic collections and individual portfolios within that collection (including: proxy settings, URL, parser parameters, inventory management groups, etc.).

### The License API

The license API requires the creation of a "license object" that is pushed to Alma via a standard *post* using the API. This license object is detailed in the [Alma documentation](https://developers.exlibrisgroup.com/alma/apis/docs/xsd/rest_license.xsd/?tags=POST). However, this documentation is not clear regarding several key XML structural details that are necessary in the proper formation of the license object.

### Types of Import Profiles
<br />

**New Order**: Used for loading bibliographic records with embedded order data (EOD). This profile will create a new bibliographic record, a PO-Line from the embedded order data, and physical/electronic inventory. (e.g., GOBI approvals, Kanopy)

**Update Inventory**: Used for updating inventory or bibliographic records with an associated PO-Line. The only match point in this profile is the PO line reference number. (e.g., FY23 purchases needing payment in Alma)

**Repository**: Used for loading/updating bibliographic records and physical/electronic inventory (e.g., Streaming video collections, E-Resource collections)
